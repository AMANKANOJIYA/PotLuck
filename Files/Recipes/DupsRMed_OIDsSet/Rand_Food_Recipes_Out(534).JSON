Melt the butter and add the celeryand onion to a medium pot and saute over medium heat for about 8 minutes.Step 2: Stir in 2/3 cup flour, salt and pepper, celery seed, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the the mixture begins to thicken and then simmer lightly until thickened. Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).</li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.</li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>", "_id": 632625}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false,

It takes 10 minutes to prepare, is made from ingredients that are readily available and is a bargain when you consider the number of servings it provides.  One caution -  you'll have mush with  Asian flavor if you cook this for more than 5 to 6 hours. The recipe is adapted from \"Slow Cooker Recipes for All Occasions\",  a Rival Crock-Pot publication.  Served with rice and snow peas you have the makings of a minor feast that you'll repeat often. My family loves this dish. I think yours will, too. This, by the way, is a wonderful recipe for novice cooks. If you have a willing teen, let them have a go at it.Asian-Style Country Ribs with Black Bean Garlic SauceIngredients:3 to 4 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs, cross cut in 1-1/2-inch pieces3 tablespoons prepared black bean garlic sauce from a jar (i.e. Lee Kum Kee)1/4 cup low-sodium soy salt1/4 cup mirin or chicken stock1 tablespoon honey1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger root1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh garlic1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper1 tablespoon cornstarch2 teaspoons dark sesame oil1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons chopped scallions (white and tender green)Directions:1) Spray interior of slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place pork cubes in slow cooker. Combine black bean garlic sauce, soy sauce, mirin, honey, ginger, garlic, pepper and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir to dissolve cornstarch. Pour over ribs.2) Cook, covered, on LOW setting for 5 to 6 hours until ribs are tender but still hold their shape. Transfer ribs to a rimmed serving platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Strain liquid into a small pan. Bring liquid to a boil over medium-high heat; cook until mixture begins to thicken and is reduced by half. Stir in sesame oil. Add sauce and 1/4 cup scallions to pork cubes.  Mix well. Garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons scallions.

Pour the marinade over the salmon and allow it to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours covered in the refrigerator).  Turn your oven on high broil. Just before putting the salmon in the oven, drizzle the lemon juice over the fish.

Wash the asparagus and cut off the bottom inch and a half of each stalk and discard.  Spread the asparagus on in a large skillet. Drizzle the lemon grapeseed oil over the asparagus and spread the oil on the asparagus with your hands so that all stalks are completely coated.  Sprinkle asparagus with desired amount of salt and pepper. Saut over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the two tablespoons of vegetable stock and cover the skillet. Saut 4 minutes. Remove lid and add the minced garlic. Place cover back over the asparagus. Continue cooking an additional 3 to 5 minutes until asparagus is cooked but not too soft.

Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these!

Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil.

Crush the garlic with either a pestle or the bottom of a spoon until it is a paste.</li><li>Spread the roasted garlic paste over the pizza dough.</li><li>Sprinkle/crumble your cheese of choice over the pizza dough.</li><li>Place the vegetables on top of the cheese.</li><li>Cook pizza for approximately 20 minutes (plus or minus a few minutes depending on your oven), waiting for the crust to become golden brown.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>", "_id": 665294}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "veryPopular": false, "sustainable": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 27, "gaps": "no", "lowFodmap": false, "ketogenic": false, "whole30": false, "servings": 2, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodista.com/recipe/NPBK7LVQ/parmesan-chicken-nuggets", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/parmesan-chicken-nuggets-654663", "aggregateLikes": 61, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "sourceName": "Foodista", "extendedIngredients": [{"id": 1002030, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pepper.jpg", "name": "black pepper", "amount": 2.0, "unit": "servings", "unitShort": "servings", "unitLong": "servings", "originalString": "Black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"]}, {"id": 5062, "aisle": "Meat", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chicken-breasts.jpg", "name": "boneless chicken breast", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "1 boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced", "metaInformation": ["boneless", "thinly sliced"]}, {"id": 18079, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/breadcrumbs.jpg", "name": "breadcrumbs", "amount": 0.5, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "\u00bd cup homemade breadcrumbs", "metaInformation": ["homemade"]}, {"id": 1001, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "name": "butter", "amount": 4.0, "unit": "tbsp", "unitShort": "T", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "originalString": "4 tbsp butter, softened and diced", "metaInformation": ["diced", "softened"]}, {"id": 1123, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "name": "egg", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "1 egg, lightly beaten", "metaInformation": ["lightly beaten"]}, {"id": 11297, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parsley.jpg", "name": "fresh parsley", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "tbs", "unitShort": "tbs", "unitLong": "tb", "originalString": "1 tbs fresh parsley, chopped", "metaInformation": ["fresh", "chopped"]}, {"id": 11215, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg", "name": "garlic clove", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "1 garlic clove, crushed", "metaInformation": ["crushed"]}, {"id": 1011033, "aisle": "Cheese", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/parmesan-or-romano.jpg", "name": "grana padano cheese", "amount": 0.25, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "\u00bc cup Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese, grated", "metaInformation": ["grated"]}, {"id": 4025, "aisle": "Condiments", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mayonnaise.jpg", "name": "mayonnaise", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1/3 cup mayonnaise", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 2047, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "name": "salt and pepper", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "pinch", "unitShort": "pinch", "unitLong": "pinch", "originalString": "Pinch of salt and black pepper", "metaInformation": ["black"]}, {"aisle": "?", "name": "fromage frais", "amount": 0.3333333333333333, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1/3 cup fromage frais (farmer's cheese)", "metaInformation": ["(farmer's cheese)"]}], "title": "Parmesan chicken nuggets", "readyInMinutes": 45, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Parmesan-chicken-nuggets-654663.jpg", "imageType": "jpg", "cuisines": [], "instructions": "<ol><li>Cut the fillet into four to five smaller pieces.</li><li>Mix and combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan and parsley in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.</li><li>Dip the chicken pieces into the beaten egg, then into the breadcrumb mixture.</li><li>Place in a single layer on a small baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or even overnight.</li><li>Meanwhile, make the garlic mayonnaise.

Transfer to the breadcrumb mixture and coat, pressing the crumbs into the florets, the help them adhere. Place on the oiled baking sheet, making sure you leave a little space between each florets so they crisp up really well. Repeat this step with the rest of the cauliflower.

Pulse the undrained tomatoes in a food processor a few times until mostly broken down. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil with the garlic and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat until just sizzling. Add the tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes until the marinara thickens slightly and the flavors develop. Add 2 tablespoons of the fresh basil, season with salt and pepper if needed.</li><li>When the cauliflower is done baking, transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining basil.

"instructions": "<ol><li>Directions:</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 by 9 or 7 by 11 baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li><li>Combine the flax, applesauce and almond milk together in a small bowl. Set aside to allow to thicken. In a food processor, combine the blueberries, pear, black beans and oil. Pulse until the mixture become very smooth. Next, add the extracts and process until fully combined. Remove the contents from processor into a medium sized mixing bowl. Add the coconut sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt and mix. Add the flour with the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into your prepared dish and bake at 350 for 44-45 minutes.</li><li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 50 minutes. If you would like, place the brownies in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes to speed up cooling time. While the brownies cool, start on your mint filling.</li><li>In a small bowl, combine the soft avocado with full fat coconut milk or heavy cream. Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Add the powdered xylitol and mix well. Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread. Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.</li><li>Next, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.</li><li>Cut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li><li>NOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.</li><li>*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.</li><li>**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.</li></ol>", "_id": 646491}, {"vegetarian": true, "vegan": true, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": true, "veryHealthy":

Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>", "_id": 715544}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "veryPopular": false, "sustainable": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 1, "gaps": "no", "lowFodmap": false, "ketogenic": false, "whole30": false, "servings": 168, "sourceUrl": "http://www.foodista.com/recipe/BWMDD2VQ/chocolate-date-cake-with-chocolate-sticky-toffee-glaze", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/chocolate-date-cake-with-chocolate-sticky-toffee-glaze-639267", "aggregateLikes": 15, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "sourceName": "Foodista", "extendedIngredients": [{"id": 18372, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg", "name": "baking soda", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "teaspoons", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoons baking soda", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 19903, "aisle": "Sweet Snacks", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg", "name": "bittersweet chocolate", "amount": 5.0, "unit": "ounces", "unitShort": "oz", "unitLong": "ounces", "originalString": "110 gr.

Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.</li><li>Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.</li><li>Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.</li></ol>", "_id": 646673}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy": false,

assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.

garlic. Set aside.</li><li>Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.</li><li>Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.</li><li>Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.</li><li>Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.</li><li>Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.</li><li>Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.</li><li>In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.</li><li>Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.</li><li>Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.</li><li>With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.</li><li>Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.</li><li>Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread.

"imageType": "jpg", "cuisines": [], "instructions": "<ol><li>Measure flour mix, using a large spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup, then level it off with the back of a knife. Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.  Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.</li><li>Add dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.</li><li>Using a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.</li><li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>", "_id": 632085}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy":

degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with foil and spray it with a nonstick spray. Season the pork tenderloin generously with the lemon pepper seasoning, rubbing it all over. Place the pork tenderloin on the prepared baking sheet and spray the pork with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven and roast for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until done to your liking. Use an instant read thermometer for desired level of doneness. I cooked mine to 145 degrees F for medium rare (see note).While the pork is roasting, prepare your crumbled cornbread. To a large bowl, add the cornbread, egg, jalapeno, parsley, green onions, salt and black pepper to taste, and milk. Stir to combine and pour it into an oven-safe baking dish that has been sprayed with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven with pork and bake for 20 minutes or until slightly brown on top. Remove from oven and cover with foil to keep warm while you prepare the rest of your meal.When the pork has finished roasting, remove it from the oven and pour the juices (if there are any) into a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cover the pork tenderloin with a foil tent and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Add the butter to the pan with the juices. If the pork has not released any juices, add an extra tablespoon or two of butter. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour. Let cook for a minute or until golden brown, then whisk in the chicken broth and continue whisking until the sauce is a thick gravy. Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove from heat.Slice the pork and set it over a bed of cornbread stuffing.Serve with your favorite veggies and enjoy!", "_id": 729531}, {"vegetarian": true, "vegan": true, "glutenFree": true, "dairyFree": true, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "veryPopular": false, "sustainable": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 4, "gaps": "no", "lowFodmap": false, "ketogenic": false, "whole30": true, "servings": 4, "sourceUrl": "http://foodandspice.blogspot.com/2016/08/mango-banana-coconut-smoothie.html", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/mango-banana-coconut-smoothie-798956", "aggregateLikes": 27, "creditText": "Lisa's Vegetarian Kitchen", "license": "CC BY 2.5 CA", "sourceName": "Food and Spice", "extendedIngredients": [{"id": 9040, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/bananas.jpg", "name": "banana", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1 frozen banana (2/3 cup sliced)", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "sliced"]}, {"id": 12118, "aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/coconut-milk.jpg", "name": "coconut milk", "amount": 0.6666666666666666, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "2/3 cup coconut milk", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 9087, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/dates.jpg", "name": "dates", "amount": 3.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "3 pitted dates, chopped", "metaInformation": ["pitted", "chopped"]}, {"id": 9176, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/mango.jpg", "name": "mango", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup frozen mango pieces (1/2 large mango)", "metaInformation": ["frozen", "large", "(1/2 mango)"]}, {"id": 2043, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/turmeric.jpg", "name": "turmeric", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoon turmeric", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 14412, "aisle": "Beverages", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/water.jpg", "name": "water", "amount": 1.5, "unit": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1 1/2 cups water", "metaInformation": []}], "title": "Mango Banana Coconut Smoothie", "readyInMinutes": 45, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/mango-banana-coconut-smoothie-798956.jpg", "imageType": "jpg", "cuisines": [], "instructions": "<p>Prepare the banana the night before.

Cook about 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove pan from heat and let sit, covered for 10 minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork. Add the cilantro and lime juice and pepper to taste.</li><li>Make the fish: Meanwhile, pat the fish fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. In one dish place the flour, in another dish, beat the eggs and 1 T. water until mixed, and in another mix together the coconut and panko. Working with one fillet at a time, dredge fish in the flour, then pat off the excess, dip in the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl, then coat in the coconut-panko mix, pressing the coating onto the fish to be sure it adheres.</li><li>Heat the oven to 200 degrees f. (to keep the fish warm between batches). Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers and just starts to near the smoking point. Add 2 of the fillets and cook about 3 minutes per side, until the fish is golden and cooked through. Drain briefly on paper towels and place in the warm oven while cooking the remaining fish. Serve the fish and rice with the mango salsa and lime wedges.</li></ol>", "_id": 639752}, {"vegetarian": true, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": true, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "veryPopular": true, "sustainable": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 25, "gaps": "no", "lowFodmap": false, "ketogenic": false, "whole30": false, "servings": 3, "sourceUrl": "http://www.pinkwhen.com/sweet-potato-casserole-gourmet-holiday-baking/", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/sweet-potato-casserole-gourmet-holiday-baking-715380", "aggregateLikes": 9473, "creditText": "Jen West", "license": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "sourceName": "Pink When", "extendedIngredients": [{"id": 1001, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "name": "butter", "amount": 0.25, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1/4 cup Land O' Lakes unsalted butter (softened)", "metaInformation": ["unsalted", "softened", "()"]}, {"id": 1123, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "name": "eggs", "amount": 2.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "2 eggs", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 2010, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "name": "ground cinnamon", "amount": 0.5, "unit": "tsp", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "originalString": "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 1053, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg", "name": "heavy cream", "amount": 2.0, "unit": "tbsp", "unitShort": "T", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "originalString": "2 tbsp heavy cream", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 12142, "aisle": "Nuts", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "name": "pecans", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup sugared pecans (make these the day before)", "metaInformation": ["(make these the day before)"]}, {"id": 2047, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "name": "salt", "amount": 0.25, "unit": "tsp", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "originalString": "1/4 tsp salt", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 11507, "aisle": "Produce", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sweet-potato.jpg", "name": "sweet potatoes", "amount": 2.0, "unit": "cans", "unitShort": "cans", "unitLong": "cans", "originalString": "2 large cans of Sweet Potatoes (Yams) -or- 5 large cooked and peeled sweet potatoes", "metaInformation": ["large", "cooked", "peeled", "(Yams)"]}, {"id": 2050, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg", "name": "vanilla extract", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "tsp", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 tsp vanilla extract", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 19335, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "name": "white sugar", "amount": 0.5, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "1/2 cup white sugar", "metaInformation": ["white"]}], "title": "Sweet Potato Casserole Gourmet & Holiday Baking", "readyInMinutes": 45, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/sweet-potato-casserole-gourmet-holiday-baking-715380.jpg", "imageType": "jpg", "cuisines": ["american"], "instructions": "Step 3: Take your sweet potato mixture and place in a prepared 9 x 13 glass baking dish.

Whisk together all of the ingredients and set aside.For the filling, combine the carrot, radish, green onions, green chilies and snow peas. Put the herbs in another bowl and have your sprouts ready along with the mushrooms.Heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. When hot, ladle 1/2 cup of batter into the pan and spread with the bottom of the ladle until you have a roughly 6 to 8 inch pancake.  Fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until you have small holes forming and the bottom is crispy brown, then flip and fry for another few minutes on the other side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in a 150 oven while you finish the rest of the pancakes  you should finish with 4 to 6 pancakes.To serve, scatter a portion of the vegetables, herbs and mushrooms over one half of the pancake.

ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.</li><li>In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.</li><li>Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).</li><li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.</li><li>Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.</li><li>I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.</li><li>To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.</li><li>So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.</li><li>When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.</li></ol>", "_id": 636393}, {"vegetarian": true, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "veryPopular": false, "sustainable": false, "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 7, "gaps": "no", "lowFodmap": false, "ketogenic": false, "whole30": false, "servings": 24, "preparationMinutes": 20, "cookingMinutes": 50, "sourceUrl": "http://www.pinkwhen.com/cinnamon-nut-squares/", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/cinnamon-nut-squares-715389", "aggregateLikes": 43, "creditText": "Jen West", "license": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "sourceName": "Pink When", "extendedIngredients": [{"id": 1001, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "name": "butter", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup softened butter", "metaInformation": ["softened"]}, {"id": 1001, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg", "name": "butter", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoon vanilla or butter vanilla bakery emulsion", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 2010, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg", "name": "cinnamon", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "tablespoon", "unitShort": "T", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "originalString": "1 tablespoon cinnamon", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 1123, "aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg", "name": "egg", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "", "unitShort": "", "unitLong": "", "originalString": "1 egg, separated", "metaInformation": ["separated"]}, {"id": 20081, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png", "name": "flour", "amount": 2.0, "unit": "cups", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cups", "originalString": "2 cups flour", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 12142, "aisle": "Nuts", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/pecans.jpg", "name": "pecans", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup chopped pecans", "metaInformation": ["chopped"]}, {"id": 2047, "aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg", "name": "salt", "amount": 0.5, "unit": "teaspoon", "unitShort": "t", "unitLong": "teaspoons", "originalString": "\u00bd teaspoon salt", "metaInformation": []}, {"id": 19335, "aisle": "Baking", "image": "https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg", "name": "sugar", "amount": 1.0, "unit": "cup", "unitShort": "c", "unitLong": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup sugar", "metaInformation": []}], "title": "Cinnamon Nut Squares", "readyInMinutes": 70, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/cinnamon-nut-squares-715389.jpg", "imageType": "jpg", "cuisines": [], "instructions": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees.Spray an oblong baking pan with baking spray.

Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.</li><li>Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over. Set aside while you prepare the cream cheese layer.</li><li>For the cream cheese layer, place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until soft.</li><li>Add the sugar and mix to blend it in.</li><li>Add egg and beat to incorporate.</li><li>Add Bailey's and stir it in.</li><li>To assemble, spray an 8\" square baking pan with straight sides with non-stick spray, or butter and flour it. You can also line the baking pan with parchment, leaving the edges high so you can lift the entire cake out of the pan.</li><li>Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan and tilt it to spread it out evenly.</li><li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over it, and with a fork, swirl the layers so some of the chocolate shows on top and the cream cheese layer becomes part of the chocolate layer. Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.</li><li>Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not over bake.</li><li>Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into squares.</li></ol>", "_id": 644081}, {"vegetarian": false, "vegan": false, "glutenFree": false, "dairyFree": false,
